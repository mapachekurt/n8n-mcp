# MCP Server Health Check Results
**Date**: 2025-09-24 14:04  
**Environment**: Windows PowerShell 5.1 / Warp Terminal  
**Purpose**: Systematic testing of all available MCP servers to understand connectivity status

## Executive Summary

We discovered a critical gap in MCP server health monitoring within Warp. Most MCP servers that should be available are showing "Transport closed" errors, indicating systematic connectivity issues.

## Detailed Test Results

### ✅ **Working MCP Servers**

#### GitHub MCP Server
- **Status**: ✅ FULLY OPERATIONAL
- **Tools Tested**: `get_me`, `list_notifications`
- **Functionality**: Full GitHub API access working
- **Performance**: Normal response times
- **Notes**: This is our most reliable MCP server

### ❌ **Non-Working MCP Servers**

#### Context7 MCP Server  
- **Status**: ❌ TRANSPORT CLOSED
- **Tools Tested**: `resolve-library-id`
- **Error**: "Transport closed"
- **Impact**: Cannot access documentation/library resolution

#### Linear MCP Server
- **Status**: ❌ TRANSPORT CLOSED  
- **Tools Tested**: `list_teams`
- **Error**: "Transport closed"
- **Impact**: No project management integration

#### n8n MCP Server
- **Status**: ❌ TRANSPORT CLOSED
- **Tools Tested**: `list_nodes`  
- **Error**: "Transport closed"
- **Impact**: No workflow automation capabilities

#### Railway MCP Server
- **Status**: ❌ TRANSPORT CLOSED
- **Tools Tested**: `check-railway-status`, `list-projects`
- **Error**: "Transport closed"  
- **Impact**: No deployment platform access

## Critical Findings

### 1. **Systematic MCP Transport Issues**
- Multiple MCP servers showing identical "Transport closed" errors
- Suggests underlying connectivity or configuration problem
- Only GitHub MCP server functioning normally

### 2. **Environment Context Dependency**  
- **Key Learning**: MCP server availability varies dramatically between execution contexts
- Warp may have different MCP server access than Claude Desktop
- Network connectivity and authentication vary by environment

### 3. **No Health Monitoring Previously in Place**
- This was the first systematic health check performed
- No routine monitoring of MCP server status
- Critical gap in infrastructure monitoring

## Implications for Development

### **For Warp Usage**
1. **GitHub-Dependent**: Currently only GitHub operations are reliable
2. **Limited Automation**: Cannot access n8n/Railway for deployment tasks  
3. **No Documentation Access**: Context7 unavailable for library docs

### **For Claude Desktop**  
1. **May have different access**: Claude reported working n8n connections
2. **Authentication differs**: Different credential/transport mechanisms
3. **Need parallel testing**: Should verify Claude's actual MCP access

## Methodology Developed

### **Standard MCP Health Check Process**
1. **Test Core Servers**: GitHub, Context7, Linear, n8n, Railway
2. **Use Lightweight Operations**: List/get operations rather than mutations
3. **Document Response Types**: Success/Transport Closed/Authentication Error
4. **Record Timestamps**: For trend analysis
5. **Context Awareness**: Note execution environment (Warp vs Claude)

## Recommendations

### **Immediate Actions**
1. **Investigate Transport Issues**: Why are multiple MCP servers down?
2. **Verify Claude Desktop Access**: Does Claude actually have working connections?
3. **Check Authentication**: Are credentials/tokens valid for non-GitHub servers?
4. **Review Network Configuration**: Firewall/proxy issues affecting MCP transport?

### **Long-term Improvements**  
1. **Implement Routine Health Checks**: Weekly automated monitoring
2. **Create Health Dashboard**: Visual status of all MCP servers
3. **Add Alerting**: Notification when servers go down
4. **Document Troubleshooting**: Standard procedures for transport issues

### **Process Improvements**
1. **Environment-Specific Testing**: Test in both Warp and Claude contexts
2. **Credential Management**: Secure rotation and validation of MCP tokens
3. **Fallback Strategies**: Alternative approaches when MCP servers unavailable

## Next Steps

1. **Create GitHub Issue**: Document this health check for future reference
2. **Build Automated Health Check**: Warp workflow for routine monitoring  
3. **Investigate Root Cause**: Why are transports closing?
4. **Validate Claude Access**: Verify if Claude really has working MCP connections
5. **Establish Monitoring Routine**: Regular systematic health checks

---

**Key Learning**: Always verify MCP server health before assuming availability. The "Transport closed" pattern suggests systematic issues that need investigation rather than individual server problems.
